# K-Means Clustering - Mall Customer Segmentation

This project demonstrates the application of **K-Means clustering** for segmenting mall customers based on their demographics and spending behavior.

## 📁 Dataset

- **Source:** Mall Customer Segmentation Dataset
- **Features Used:** Gender, Age, Annual Income (k$), Spending Score (1-100)

## 🧰 Tools and Libraries

- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib & Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## 🚀 Tasks Performed

1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Encoded categorical `Gender` feature
   - Standardized numerical features

2. **K-Means Clustering**
   - Applied Elbow Method to determine optimal number of clusters
   - Fitted K-Means with the selected number of clusters

3. **Visualization**
   - Used PCA for 2D dimensionality reduction
   - Visualized customer clusters in 2D space

4. **Evaluation**
   - Calculated Silhouette Score to evaluate cluster quality
